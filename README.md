# fktz

A simple solution to working with [Discord Timestamps](https://gist.github.com/LeviSnoot/d9147767abeef2f770e9ddcd91eb85aa). Because f*ck timezones.

## About

Running an international team over Discord, I got tired of manually making timestamps. I also found all the existing bots tiresome, requiring everyone in the team to set their timezones and then getting it to was not the "quick and easy solution" I had hoped for. 

So I built fktz; you only need to supply a ISO-8601 timestamp and the bot will do the rest for you.

## Usage

Example command: `!ts 2025-12-30T23:59:59+04:00`
![example timezone](/docs/tz.png)

Timezone is relative to UTC, for example: `+04:30`, `-07:00`, `+00:00`
